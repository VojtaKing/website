# First post on this website
So i made my first website 

How it *works*?

- Main page is in vannila html
- and posts are using script to convert markdown to html
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as an easy-to-read markup language **says wiki**

so its just that i can write **this** and ~~this~~ and other .

*thanks for reading this i will maybe make some other post*
